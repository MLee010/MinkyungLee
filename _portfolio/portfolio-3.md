Starting with an exploration into the general structures of online discussions, it investigates the nuances of collaborative learning, specifically focusing on how learners converge in their knowledge through discourse and lexical analyses. Building on this foundation, another study also touches upon the learners' perceptions of sociograms as instructional tools, highlighting the interplay between social networks and educational outcomes. Lastly, by incorporating algorithms, the research aims to optimize group formations for online discussions, emphasizing the role of technology in ensuring conducive environments for knowledge exchange. Together, these studies provide a comprehensive insight into the effective interplay between network structures, collaborative dynamics, and learning outcomes, thereby underscoring their collective importance in the realm of contemporary education.

1. **[20AECT_SNA](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/20SNA.pdf)** - Investigates how individuals communicate within an online network, revealing patterns of interaction and influence. 

2. **[21AECT_Exploring the Role of Teaching and Cognitive Presence in Predicting Course Satisfaction within the Community of Inquiry Framework](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21Perception.pdf)**: This study examines the relationships between the elements of the CoI framework —teaching presence (TP), cognitive presence (CP), and social presence (SP)—and their ability to predict course satisfaction. Results show that TP and CP together explain 80% of course satisfaction, with TP alone accounting for 65%. While TP had the strongest influence, CP and SP had mixed outcomes. Future research will address limitations like multicollinearity and small sample size, and explore the model with more data using Structural Equation Modeling.
