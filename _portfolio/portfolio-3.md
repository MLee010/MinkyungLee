Below are some of the key papers and documents related to my work on literacy:

1. [20AECT_SNA](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/20SNA.pdf)
This exploratory study explores online discussion forums, aiming to shed light on the nuanced
interactions among participants. By visualizing and analyzing these forums, we discerned patterns based on key metrics such as directionality, centrality, and density. Our findings offer insights into how online networks form, evolve, and influence collaborative learning processes.

2. [21AECT_Knowledge Convergence](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21KC.pdf), (https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21KCproceeding.pdf)
This study investigates the influence of collaborative concept mapping tasks on learners' knowledge convergence. Participants were categorized into two distinct groups based on group contingencies: independent and interdependent. An analysis of their discourses revealed the profound impact of agency on collaboration. Interestingly, while verbatim recitation wasn't a significant predictor of knowledge convergence, prior individual map creation—which served as a reference during collaboration—played a role. Although signs of knowledge convergence were evident, it did not conclusively indicate collaborative knowledge construction in either group. Furthermore, the collaborative map produced with an informational text did not distinctly represent the outcome of knowledge convergence.

2. [21AECT_Lexical Analysis](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21Lexical.pdf)
This study investigates how collaborative concept mapping tasks affect the knowledge convergence of learners. Participants were divided into two groups by different group contingency, independent and interdependent, and discourses were analyzed. We detected delineated clusters and compared the degree and density. Though each cluster includes identical terms, slightly different terms in clusters were found by the groups—also, the average degree and average weighted degree of the interdependent group were relatively higher than the independent group.

3. [21AECT_Sociogram Perception](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21Perception.pdf)
This research examines the correlations among the elements of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework as a unified construct and evaluates its predictive capacity for overall course satisfaction using a revised CoI survey (Arbaugh et al, 2008). Our findings identify three distinct components within the CoI, each yielding varied outcomes on CP and SP. Notably, both TP and CP collectively accounted for approximately 80% of the variation in course satisfaction, with TP singularly explaining about 65% of this construct.

4. [23AERA_Community Detection Algorithm](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/23LA.pdf)
Many group formation strategies have been used within the design of asynchronous online discussions to increase their effectiveness.  In this research, we used a modularity optimization method (Blondel 2008) for community detection to explore group effectiveness by examining the network measures at global and local levels using asynchronous online discussion data. Our analysis showed some variations of network measures in groups that clearly underscore group effectiveness. Therefore, we believe this method is promising for analyzing the relations in groups to anticipate group effectiveness and identify the implications of using this algorithm for designing and analyzing effective groups in online discussions.     ![image](https://github.com/MLee010/MinkyungLee/assets/133421964/1af20644-8916-4015-8c38-41d37002cd1c)
