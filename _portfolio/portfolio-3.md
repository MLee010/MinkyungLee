**Scope (2021–2024).** This line of work applies **established social network analysis** to course-scale discussion data and, in one study, adds a **readability** perspective. The contribution is a **slightly different lens** on familiar techniques—using community detection to interpret emergent groups and linking basic text accessibility to network positions and engagement.

**Key papers**
- *Beyond posting frequency: how network metrics and textual readability relate to engagement in online discussion.* **Interactive Learning Environments** (2025). [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2025.2550035)
- **Goal:** Examine whether students’ network positions and the readability of their posts relate to subsequent engagement (replies/attention).
- **Approach:** Computed common SNA metrics (e.g., indegree, betweenness, eigenvector) and basic readability indices (e.g., Flesch, FKGL) from course discussion data.
- **Main finding:** Network position was consistently associated with engagement; readability showed smaller but meaningful associations in certain contexts.
- **Implications:** Simple structural and text features can offer instructors a practical view of where participation concentrates and how message clarity might matter.


- *Applying a community detection algorithm to examine group formation in online discussions.* **International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education** (2024). [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-024-00495-w)

- **Goal:** Identify natural subgroups in course discussions and describe how those subgroups communicate.
- **Approach:** Used the Louvain method to detect communities; compared within-group cohesion and between-group interaction using standard network measures.
- **Main finding:** Detected groups showed coherent internal communication patterns; subgroup structure aligned with how students actually interacted over time.
- **Implications:** Community detection provides a readable map of collaboration that can inform group support, moderation, or activity design.

### Overall contribution of this line
- Uses established SNA tools (and, in one study, readability indices) to look at online discussion from a slightly different angle.
- Shows how **who-talks-to-whom** and **how messages read** can be combined (or examined separately) to describe participation patterns without complex pipelines.
- Offers practical signals (e.g., subgroup cohesion, central participants, message clarity) that can guide facilitation and course adjustments.

### Notes & scope
- Results may vary by course design, topic, and assessment practices; replication in new contexts is encouraged.
