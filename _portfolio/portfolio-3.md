**[23AERA_Community Detection Algorithm](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/AERA23_Louvain.pdf)**: This study examines student interaction networks within an asynchronous discussion forum, focusing on whole group and subgroup dynamics identified through the Louvain algorithm. Analyzing 2,481 posts from 154 students across three sections of a communications course, the research highlights the role of network analysis in understanding and optimizing group interactions. The findings suggest that algorithmically detected groups exhibit strong internal communication, cohesiveness, and collaborative potential, offering insights to improve educational design, student engagement, and collaborative learning in online environments.

3. **[24AERA_Implementing Sociograms in Online Learning: Examining their Influences on Community of Inquiry Elements](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/AERA24Sociogram.pdf)]** : This paper showcases a modularity optimization method for community detection in asynchronous online discussions. The research emphasizes the potential of this method for anticipating group effectiveness and its implications for group design and analysis.
   
   **[21AECT_Exploring the Role of Teaching and Cognitive Presence in Predicting Course Satisfaction within the Community of Inquiry Framework](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21Perception.pdf)**: This study examines the relationships between the elements of the CoI framework and their ability to predict course satisfaction. Results show that TP and CP together explain 80% of course satisfaction, with TP alone accounting for 65%. While TP had the strongest influence, CP and SP had mixed outcomes.
