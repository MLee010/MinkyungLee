1. **[23AERA_Community Detection Algorithm](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/AERA23_Louvain.pdf)**: This paper showcases a modularity optimization method for community detection in asynchronous online discussions. The research emphasizes the potential of this method for anticipating group effectiveness and its implications for group design and analysis.

2. **[24AERA_Implementing Sociograms in Online Learning: Examining their Influences on Community of Inquiry Elements](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/AERA24Sociogram.pdf)]** : This paper showcases a modularity optimization method for community detection in asynchronous online discussions. The research emphasizes the potential of this method for anticipating group effectiveness and its implications for group design and analysis.
   
   **[21AECT_Exploring the Role of Teaching and Cognitive Presence in Predicting Course Satisfaction within the Community of Inquiry Framework](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21Perception.pdf)**: This study examines the relationships between the elements of the CoI framework and their ability to predict course satisfaction. Results show that TP and CP together explain 80% of course satisfaction, with TP alone accounting for 65%. While TP had the strongest influence, CP and SP had mixed outcomes.
