## Overview
This research line investigates how **scripted roles** influence social connectivity and knowledge construction in asynchronous online courses.  Using **social network analysis (SNA)** and **content analysis (CA)**, the studies connect *who interacts with whom* to *how ideas are built*.  After the dissertation was completed, the work was extended with a machine-learning study that predicts roles and knowledge-construction processes directly from discussion text.

## Papers (under review)

- *When does structure matter? Social and cognitive outcomes in role-assigned vs. organic groups.*  
  **Internet and Higher Education**  
  – Compares structured (role-assigned) and unstructured groups, revealing differences in reciprocity and patterns of elicitation and integration.

- *Which roles bridge, centralize, or synthesize collaboration in online courses?*  
  **International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (IJCSCL)**  
  – Maps each role (Moderator, Summarizer, Skeptic, Source Searcher, Theoretician) to distinct network positions and cognitive processes.

- *Predicting assigned roles and knowledge-construction processes in asynchronous discussion.*  
  **Educational Technology Research & Development (ETR&D)** – post-dissertation extension  
  – Uses lightweight lexical features to predict roles (macro-F1 ≈ 0.86) and knowledge-construction processes (macro-F1 ≈ 0.82).

## Contribution
Together these studies:
- Show how **role scripts** affect participation and knowledge building.  
- Reveal **role-specific social positions** in online networks.  
- Demonstrate the feasibility of **machine-learning support** for real-time facilitation.
