**Scope (2021–2024).** A method-development series establishing practical ways to:
- **Strand A — SNA-only:** detect emergent subgroups and examine cohesion using **Louvain/community detection** and local/global network metrics.
- **Strand B — SNA + textual features:** relate **network positions** to **text accessibility/readability** and engagement patterns.

> Note: “Pilot” refers here to *developing and validating the analytic approach*, not a small feasibility test.

**Key papers**
- **Strand B (SNA + textual features):** *Beyond posting frequency: how network metrics and textual readability relate to engagement in online discussion.*  
  *Interactive Learning Environments* (2025). [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2025.2550035)  :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **Strand A (SNA-only: Louvain/community detection):** *Leveraging the Louvain algorithm for enhanced group formation and collaboration in online learning environments.*  
  *International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education* (2024). [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41239-024-00495-w)  :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

<details><summary>Methods (click)</summary>
**Global & local SNA:** density, centralization, clustering; community detection via **Louvain**; local cohesion (within-group density, triangles, clustering).  
**Text features (Strand B only):** readability indices (Flesch, FKGL, Gunning Fog, SMOG).  
**Role:** design, analysis, writing.

### One-paragraph overview
Across course-scale discussion networks, **Strand A** shows that Louvain-identified subgroups display cohesive internal communication and stable interaction patterns useful for understanding collaboration at scale. **Strand B** links **network positions** with **text accessibility**, indicating that clearer writing often aligns with more central positions and broader engagement. Together, these strands provide practical analytics for interpreting participation and informing course design.
