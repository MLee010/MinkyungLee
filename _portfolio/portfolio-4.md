## Collaborations (2023–2024)
Projects integrating **virtual reality (VR)** and other active-learning approaches into engineering courses, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses.

### Active Learning Preferences
**Lee**, Cutler, Zappe, Spiegel, Osunbunmi (2024).  
**Student preferences and performance in active learning online environments.** 
*ASEE* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--48018)  
Examined relationships between students’ instructional mode preferences and course performance across statistics, material jetting, and Python modules. VR was favored for some subjects while self-study aligned with higher performance in others.

### Applied Improvisation
Xia, Cutler, Osunbunmi, Zappe, Gomez, Velegol, **Lee** (2024).  
**The impact of applied improvisation on undergraduate engineering students’ professional development.** 
*Advances in Engineering Education* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.18260/3-1-1153-36069)  
Assessed an improvisation workshop within a summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. Participants reported stronger communication skills, growth mindset, and collaboration.

### Virtual Reality for Machine Design
**Quantitative study** – Gregg, Cortes, Osunbunmi, Pauley, **Lee** (2024).  
**Designing and evaluating VR applications for a machine design course.** 
*ASEE* [DOI](https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--47139)  
Compared VR-enhanced instruction with traditional methods in a Machine Design course. Students using VR showed greater knowledge gains, confidence, and engagement.

**Qualitative study** – Cortes, Gregg, **Lee**, Pauley, Osunbunmi (2024).  
*By students, for students: Development of custom VR applications for teaching and learning in engineering courses.* 
*FIE*  
Describes multidisciplinary student teams creating VR modules (Unity) for machine design. The process fostered innovation and produced immersive learning tools.
