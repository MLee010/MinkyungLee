I am currently leading four research:

1.	Effectiveness of the Louvain Algorithm for Group Formation: This study investigates the utility of the Louvain algorithm in creating effective learning groups. The study is under review, and it examines how algorithmically generated groups impact the collaborative learning process, potentially offering a novel, data-informed approach to group formation in educational settings (Submitted to the Journal of Educational Computing Research). 

2.	Students' Perceptions in Sociograms and Relationship with the Community of Inquiry (CoI): This research, which is currently in revision, investigates how students perceive sociograms—visual representations of learner interaction within learning communities—and their correlation with the CoI framework. By examining these perceptions, the study aims to understand the role of sociograms in fostering a sense of community and facilitating meaningful engagement (Revision to Internet and Higher Education).

3.	Dynamics of Role Assignment in Asynchronous Discussions: This study analyzes the impact of designated roles on collaborative knowledge construction within asynchronous online discussions. This project seeks to identify role assignment strategies that optimize engagement and equity among learners (Dissertation).

4.	Network Dynamics and Response Behaviors in Asynchronous Discussions: This research is to uncover the complexities of student response patterns within asynchronous discussions, with the aim of enhancing engagement across all participants. By analyzing the interactions that lead to varying levels of responses among students, the study intends to understand the underlying factors that contribute to such disparities (Submitted to the Learning Analytics and Knowledge).
