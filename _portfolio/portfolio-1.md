**Focus (2018–2022).** Early Ph.D. work examining how externally provided concept structures influence individual understanding and collaborative maps.

**Key paper**
- *The influence of external concept structures on an individual’s knowledge structures.* **ETR&D** (2022). [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11423-022-10144-6)

**What this study did **
- Based on a 2019 AECT poster; subsequently developed into a peer-reviewed empirical paper (submitted Feb 2021; published 2022).
- Compared presentation formats and a card-sort task to see how they shape **knowledge organization**.
- Found improved comprehension in the text condition and distinct organization patterns across individuals and groups, suggesting instructional value of **external conceptual models**.
