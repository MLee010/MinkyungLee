Below are some of the key papers and documents related to my work on literacy:

1. [LangComparison](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/14language.pdf) - A comparative analysis of different languages and their impact on literacy.



2. [AffectiveVariables](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/16affective.pdf) - An exploration of the emotional and psychological factors affecting literacy.
This research explores the relationships between foreign language anxiety (FLA), self-efficacy (CSE), and perceptions of the English language among Korean EFL middle school students. Using three standardized instruments, findings revealed that lower proficiency students faced more anxiety in interlanguage phonology, while advanced students grappled with interlanguage meaning. Additionally, higher CSE correlated with reduced FLA, and a positive perception of English was associated with both diminished FLA and elevated CSE. The results underscore the complex interplay between language anxiety, proficiency level, and self-efficacy in language education.
