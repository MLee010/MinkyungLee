1. [**Language_Comparison**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/14language.pdf) - Demonstrates how different languages influence literacy and communication processes. The paper examines phonological, morphological, and writing system differences, especially highlighting challenges for Korean students in English pronunciation. It culminates in pedagogical recommendations based on these linguistic insights.

2. [**Proficiency**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/14Proficiency.pdf) - Emphasizes the importance of functional literacy. By focusing on the TOEFL scores in Korea, we see the tangible results of effective English education and its emphasis on communicative skills.
This research centers on students' English proficiency levels and their perceptions of English education in public schools. The results underline the success of Korea's shift to emphasizing communicative English skills and reveal interesting insights into students' self-confidence regarding their English capabilities.

3. [**Affective_Variables**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/16affective.pdf) - Addresses the emotional and psychological factors that can both strengthen and hinder literacy skills. This work investigates the correlation between foreign language anxiety, core self-efficacy, and perceptions of the English language among Korean middle school students. The study reveals patterns in proficiency levels and shows that positive English perceptions can mitigate anxiety and strengthen self-efficacy.
