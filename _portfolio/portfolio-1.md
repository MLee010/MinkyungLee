Below are some of the key papers and documents related to my work on literacy:

1. **[LangComparison](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/14language.pdf)** - A comparative analysis of different languages and their impact on literacy.
This study provides a linguistic comparison between Korean, Japanese, and English, exploring their primary features and pointing out their similarities and differences. A thorough phonological analysis highlights the unique challenges Korean students face in English pronunciation. Furthermore, the research touches on morphological differences and various writing systems. The paper concludes with pedagogical implications derived from the linguistic findings.

2. **[AffectiveVariables](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/16affective.pdf)** - Insights into emotional and psychological factors influencing literacy.
This paper probes the relationship between foreign language anxiety (FLA), core self-efficacy (CSE), and perceptions of the English language among Korean EFL middle school students. Distinctive patterns emerge based on proficiency levels; for instance, beginners often struggle with interlanguage phonology, while advanced learners grapple with interlanguage meaning. The research reveals that higher CSE is inversely related to FLA, and a positive English perception is correlated with both lower FLA and heightened CSE.
