title: "Exploring Knowledge Organization and Convergence: The Role of External Tools in Individual and Collaborative Learning"
excerpt: "The first study(19AECT & 22ETR&D) explores how pre-established conceptual frameworks enhance individual comprehension and knowledge structuring, demonstrating that structured text formats improve learners' ability to organize information. The second study(21AECT) investigates collaborative concept mapping, revealing that while these tools support the organization of group knowledge, they do not automatically lead to deeper knowledge convergence without active interaction and negotiation. Together, these studies highlight the critical role of structured learning environments and tools in fostering both individual understanding and group-based knowledge construction, offering key insights for educational practices aimed at improving cognitive engagement and collaboration"

1. [**The impact of applied improvisation on undergraduate engineering studentsâ€™ professional development**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/Xia24_improv.pdf) - This study explores how visual representations aid in organizing and understanding information. It highlights the effectiveness of visual tools, such as cross-classification tables, in enhancing learning and memory retention.
   
2. [**Student Preferences and Performance in Active Learning Online Environments**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/student-preferences-and-performance-in-active-learning-online-environments) - Expanded from the 19AECT Poster and submitted in February 2021, this research examines how pre-established conceptual frameworks influence individuals' understanding. The study analyzed the impact of different information presentation methods on participants' knowledge structures. Participants engaged with different text formats and sorting tasks were conducted. Results indicated that those in the text group showed improved comprehension in follow-up tests. Additionally, the study revealed variations in knowledge organization across collective groups and individual networks. These findings underscore the importance of external conceptual models in guiding cognitive comprehension, suggesting their potential application in educational contexts.

[**Designing and Evaluating Virtual Reality Applications for a Machine Design Course**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/designing-and-evaluating-virtual-reality-applications-for-a-machine-design-course),[**By students, for students: Development of custom Virtual Reality applications for teaching and learning in engineering courses**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/FIE_VR24.pdf) - This study investigates how collaborative concept mapping tasks influence knowledge convergence among learners. Participants were divided into two groups: independent and interdependent, and their collaboration was analyzed through discourse. The study aimed to explore whether structured group work leads to deeper learning and knowledge sharing. The study found that collaborative concept mapping, while useful, did not lead to significant knowledge convergence in this context. The use of individual maps as a reference and reliance on tool functions reduced the need for in-depth discussions.
