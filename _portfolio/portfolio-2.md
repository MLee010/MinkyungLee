1. [**19AECT_Knowledge Structure**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/19KS.pdf) - This study explores how visual representations aid in organizing and understanding information. It highlights the effectiveness of visual tools, such as cross-classification tables, in enhancing learning and memory retention.
   
2. [**22ETR&D Knowledge Structure**](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-022-10144-6) - Expanded from the 19AECT Poster and submitted in February 2021, this research examines how pre-established conceptual frameworks influence individuals' understanding. The study analyzed the impact of different information presentation methods on participants' knowledge structures. Participants engaged with different text formats and sorting tasks were conducted. Results indicated that those in the text group showed improved comprehension in follow-up tests. Additionally, the study revealed variations in knowledge organization across collective groups and individual networks. These findings underscore the importance of external conceptual models in guiding cognitive comprehension, suggesting their potential application in educational contexts.

2. **[21AECT_Knowledge Convergence](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21KC.pdf)** ([Proceedings](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21KCproceeding.pdf)),[21AECT_Lexical Analysis](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/21Lexical.pdf): Overall, the study found that collaborative concept mapping, while useful, did not lead to significant knowledge convergence in this context. The use of individual maps as a reference and reliance on tool functions reduced the need for in-depth discussions.
