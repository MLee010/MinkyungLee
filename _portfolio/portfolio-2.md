## Overview
This research line investigates how **scripted roles** influence social connectivity and knowledge construction in asynchronous online courses. Using **social network analysis (SNA)** and **content analysis (CA)**, the studies connect *who interacts with whom* to *how ideas are built*. After the dissertation was completed, the work was extended with a machine-learning study that predicts roles and knowledge-construction processes directly from discussion text.

- **When does structure matter? Social and cognitive outcomes in role-assigned vs. organic groups.**  
  *Internet and Higher Education* 
  – Compares structured (role-assigned) and unstructured groups, revealing differences in reciprocity and patterns of elicitation and integration.

  *International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (IJCSCL)*  
  – Maps each role (Moderator, Summarizer, Skeptic, Source Searcher, Theoretician) to distinct network positions and cognitive processes.

## Contribution
Together these studies:
- Show how **role scripts** affect participation and knowledge building.  
- Reveal **role-specific social positions** in online networks.  
- Demonstrate the feasibility of **machine-learning support** for real-time facilitation.
