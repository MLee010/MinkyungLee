These studies shed light on how visual representations, particularly tables, impact our comprehension and recall. Understanding how learners structure information can greatly influence pedagogical methods.

1. [**19AECT_Knowledge Structure**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/19KS.pdf) - Explores how visual representations can aid in organizing and understanding information. The research highlights the effectiveness of visual tools like cross-classification tables in enhancing learning and memory retention.
   
3. [**22ETR&D Knowledge Structure**](https://mlee010.github.io/MinkyungLee/files/22KS.pdf) - Expanded from the 19 AECT Poster, submitted in February 2021. This research investigates the influence of pre-established conceptual frameworks on shaping an individual's understanding. The study analyzed the effects of various information presentation methods on the participants' knowledge structures. After undergoing a knowledge structure (KS) assessment, participants engaged with specific text formats. The outcome highlighted that participants in the text group exhibited enhanced comprehension in subsequent tests. Furthermore, variations were observed in knowledge organization among collective groups and individual networks. These insights emphasize the significance of using external conceptual models to guide cognitive comprehension, hinting at their potential utility in pedagogical contexts.
