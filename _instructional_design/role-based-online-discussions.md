excerpt: "Embedding role scaffolds into an existing team project to guide participation, synthesis, and critique in asynchronous discussions."

### Course Context and Design Problem
This design was implemented in a fully online, asynchronous undergraduate Information Systems course with a team-based project. A key challenge was that teams often contributed unevenly and relied on surface-level agreement during online discussions.

### Instructional Design Solution
I embedded a role-based structure into the existing course project by explicitly assigning roles within teams. Each role carried distinct interactional responsibilities, while the course content, cases, and deliverables remained the same across teams.

### Roles Implemented
- **Moderator**: supports interaction flow and coordination  
- **Summarizer**: integrates ideas across posts  
- **Skeptic**: challenges assumptions and raises counterpoints  
- **Source Searcher**: introduces external information and evidence  
- **Theoretician**: connects ideas to conceptual or theoretical principles  

### Key Design Decisions
- Roles were explicitly assigned within teams and tied to clear interaction responsibilities  
- The role structure was embedded into an existing project (not added as a separate activity)  
- Teams were compared as **Structured (roles)** vs. **Unstructured (no roles)** to examine participation patterns  

### Observed Impact
Teams with assigned roles showed more distributed participation and clearer patterns of synthesis, critique, and information sharing. Certain roles (especially Summarizer and Skeptic) tended to function as interaction hubs, helping guide collaboration and improve discussion quality.

### Design Reflection and Iteration
Role clarity mattered more than discussion length. Some roles required additional support to balance cognitive demands, and the approach appears adaptable to other online, team-based learning contexts.
