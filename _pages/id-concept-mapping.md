### Course Context and Design Problem
This instructional design was implemented in a graduate-level course where students were expected to develop an integrated understanding of complex, interrelated concepts. While students were able to identify key ideas individually, they often struggled to articulate relationships among concepts and to reconcile differing interpretations during group work.

### Instructional Design Solution
I designed a two-step concept mapping task that moved students from individual externalization of understanding to collaborative negotiation.

Students were first asked to create an individual concept map identifying key ideas from the course materials. They then met in groups of three in an online setting to construct a single shared concept map containing a minimum of twenty concepts. Groups were required to clearly label relationships and submit a finalized map representing their collective understanding.

### Key Design Elements
- Clear prompts and structured learner instructions  
- A minimum concept requirement to guide depth and completeness  
- Visual mapping as a scaffold for articulating conceptual relationships  
- Collaboration guidelines to support comparison, justification, and negotiation of ideas  

### Observed Impact
Students engaged actively in comparing and merging their individual understandings. Groups with more balanced preparation demonstrated richer discussion and more explicit reasoning about conceptual relationships. The structure of the task supported deeper explanation and clarification of how concepts were connected.

### Design Reflection and Iteration
Based on implementation, several refinements were identified. Pre-task workload can be reduced to avoid cognitive overload. Guiding questions (e.g., “Why are these concepts connected?”) can further support negotiation during group work. A brief post-activity reflection may help consolidate learning and encourage metacognitive awareness.
