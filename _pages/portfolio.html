"Welcome to my portfolio. Central to my research is the theme of 'Interaction and Comprehension in Learning Environments'. 
My early work explored literacy and knowledge structures, understanding them as foundational elements in the way individuals learn and process information. 
Later, I investigated how these foundations engage with and are manifested in broader, collective settings, especially within networked learning environments. 
Journey with me to catch the intricate relationship between the nuances of individual understanding and the vast realm of collaborative learning."
