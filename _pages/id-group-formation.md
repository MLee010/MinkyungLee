### Course Context and Design Problem
This instructional design was implemented in a graduate-level hybrid seminar for Engineering Teaching Assistants. Informal group formation led to uneven participation patterns, with some students dominating discussions while quieter participants remained peripheral.

### Instructional Design Solution
I implemented a data-informed group formation strategy using early interaction data and the Louvain community detection algorithm. The goal was to form structurally balanced groups that supported equitable participation and sustained collaboration over time.

### Implementation in the Course
The design was carried out in four stages:
1. **Collection of early interaction data** from initial seminar discussions to examine who interacted with whom and how often  
2. **Application of Louvain community detection** to identify natural clusters in the interaction network  
3. **Formation of stable discussion and project groups** that balanced more central and less central participants  
4. **Integration into course flow**, with groups announced early and maintained across discussions, peer feedback, and mini-projects  

### Observed Impact
Participation became more evenly distributed across group members. Discussions showed stronger reciprocity and reduced reliance on a single dominant voice. Group work progressed more smoothly and was perceived as fair and purpose-driven rather than arbitrary. Instructors also spent less time addressing group issues and reassignments.

### Design Reflection and Iteration
Future iterations could combine network-based grouping with brief learner preference data, such as teaching interests or prior experience. Providing a short orientation explaining the rationale for structured groups may further support buy-in. Simple visual feedback could also help teaching assistants monitor collaboration patterns over time.
