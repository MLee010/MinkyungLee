I design instructional interventions that structure collaboration and support deeper sensemaking in online and seminar-based learning environments. The projects below summarize three related instructional design approaches that I have implemented and refined across graduate and undergraduate contexts. 

### Selected Instructional Design Projects

**Designing Collaborative Sensemaking with Concept Mapping (/instructional_design/sensemaking-concept-mapping/)**  
A two-step activity that moved students from individual concept mapping to group negotiation, supporting deeper explanation of relationships among complex concepts.

**Structuring High-Quality Online Discussions with Assigned Roles (/instructional_design/assigned-roles/)**  
Explicit role assignments (e.g., moderator, skeptic, summarizer) were used to guide peer interaction, leading to more distributed participation and clearer synthesis in online discussions.

**Data-Informed Group Formation to Improve Seminar Collaboration (/instructional_design/data-informed-group-formation/)**  
Network-based grouping methods were used to form structurally balanced discussion groups, resulting in stronger reciprocity and reduced reliance on a single dominant voice.
