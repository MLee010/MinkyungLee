### Course Context and Design Problem
This instructional design was implemented in a fully online, asynchronous undergraduate Information Systems course with a team-based project. While students participated regularly, discussions often showed uneven contribution patterns and tended toward surface-level agreement rather than critical engagement.

### Instructional Design Solution
To address this issue, I embedded an explicit role-based structure into an existing team project. Roles were assigned within each group to carry distinct interactional responsibilities during online discussions, while course content, cases, and deliverables remained identical across teams.

### Roles Implemented
- **Moderator**: supported interaction flow and coordination  
- **Summarizer**: integrated ideas across discussion posts  
- **Skeptic**: challenged assumptions and raised counterpoints  
- **Source Searcher**: introduced external information and evidence  
- **Theoretician**: connected discussion ideas to conceptual or theoretical principles  

### Key Design Decisions
- Roles were explicitly assigned within teams rather than emerging organically  
- Each role carried clear interactional responsibilities  
- The role structure was embedded into an existing course project, not added as an extra task  
- Teams were compared as **Structured (assigned roles)** versus **Unstructured (no roles)** during the discussion phase  

### Observed Impact
Teams with assigned roles demonstrated more distributed participation and clearer patterns of synthesis, critique, and information sharing. Certain roles, particularly Summarizer and Skeptic, functioned as interaction hubs that helped guide collaboration and improve discussion quality within a standard online course design.

### Design Reflection and Iteration
Role clarity appeared to matter more than discussion length. Some roles required additional instructional support to balance cognitive demands. Overall, the framework proved adaptable to other online, team-based learning contexts as a lightweight scaffold for collaborative analysis.
