Iâ€™m Minkyung Lee, a Ph.D. graduate in Learning Design and Technology from Penn State University. My research investigates the cognitive and social dimensions of learning, with a particular focus on collaborative and networked environments. I study how structured roles, group dynamics, and patterns of interaction shape knowledge construction and learner engagement, drawing on methods such as Social Network Analysis and Machine Learning.

This portfolio highlights my academic work and publications, which connect empirical research to practical strategies for enhancing learning in higher education and digital learning contexts.

I am especially interested in how data-informed insights can guide instructional design, improve student engagement, and create more equitable learning environments.

Thank you for visiting!
