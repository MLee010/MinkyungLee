Greetings! I'm Minkyung Lee, a doctoral candidate in Learning Design and Technologies at Penn State University. My research endeavors are rooted in understanding the nuances of literacy and knowledge structures, viewing them as foundational knowledge for individual comprehension and learning. As my academic journey unfolded, I became increasingly intrigued by how these foundational concepts intertwine and manifest within the expansive world of networked learning environments, giving rise to unique interactions and profound revelations.

In this digital portfolio, you'll discover a summary of my academic works, each bearing evidence of my commitment to enriching both individual understanding and collective communication in diverse learning scenarios. Beyond these works, I cherish the ethos of continual learning and eagerly welcome collaborative opportunities and thought exchanges. I invite you to journey alongside me, navigating the complex interplay between literacy, knowledge structures, and the dynamics of connected learning spaces.
