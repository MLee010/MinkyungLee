In my professional journey, I have taken on various roles at prestigious institutions like Penn State University and Seoul National University. Within the role, I contributed significantly to projects spanning online learning methodologies, flipped classroom models, and MOOC design. Notably, I have been involved in many NSF-funded projects, evaluating and innovating in the realms of engineering education. The expertise in digital tools, including Python, R, SPSS, and NVivo, is reflective of a deep commitment to bridging the gap between technology and education. Beyond research, I have taught English in K-12 settings and designed courses at institutions.
