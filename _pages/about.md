I'm Minkyung Lee, a recent Ph.D. graduate in Learning Design and Technology from Penn State University. My research centers on understanding the cognitive and social aspects of learning, with a focus on collaborative and networked environments. I have explored how structured roles, group dynamics, and interaction patterns influence knowledge construction and learner engagement, using methods such as Social Network Analysis and Machine Learning.

This digital portfolio presents my academic work, including studies that examine how learners interact and build knowledge in diverse educational contexts. My goal has always been to connect research findings to practical strategies that enhance learning experiences for individuals and groups.

I value collaboration and thoughtful discussions that deepen our understanding of how people learn and interact. I invite you to browse my portfolio and learn more about my work in the fields of collaborative learning, knowledge construction, and educational technology.
